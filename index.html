        <p class="lead">Created an AI history app that pulls down some initial sections but has unlimited ways to expand, speak with a "history teacher" and soon will have streaks for learning! This was just for family members, but maybe someday will release. Had a lot of fun figuring out how to make the star wars effect happen though.</p>

The app includes handy widgets, fun interactions, and the ability to share your runs. You can set a goal for the month and keep track of that as well! No sign in required.</p>

I started 2 months before I actually graduated but it gave me great experience working with a full blown UI team and backend services. They were into <b>custom UX</b> so I had a lot of practice working on custom elements. I also worked on the Skate app before leaving Nike.</p>

Gave me a lot of practice with interacting with social API's and a robust networking layer. Much more influence was given here than my last job over UI and UX.

          <p class="lead">This was an app I did with a friend of mine, Will Yee, and it's been a ton of fun. We gained some followers because a few teachers would use this app for extra credit after a test. If they completed 5 summaries they'd get a few extra credit points on a test on random subjects. It was my first foray into <b>UIDynamics</b>. Check out the history tab when you have at least a page of upvoted articles!</p>

          <h3>Other Projects</h4>
          <h4><a href="https://github.com/ryleyherrington/boggle">Boggle Solver</a></h4>
          <p>This is a Boggle Solver in C++ it uses a Trie structure to read in a dictionary and then we search that trie structure for words. The idea is that you build a trie from a given dictionary and once you have that built you start looking for words given an input BoggleSquare. It will traverse the trie and only search letters if there are children in the trie so it cuts down on that versus a hashtable. </p>
          <p>The best part of this was optimizing it to make it really fast. I haven't added threading yet but next time I have a second of free time I will add some threading and then saving the built dictionary for use later.</p>

          <h4><a href="https://github.com/ryleyherrington/sudoku_496">Sudoku Solver</a></h4>
          <p>Sudoku solver instance with a Google App Engine backend. This just allowed people to put in their sudoku puzzle online and it would spit out the answer. Written in Python and was fun to add some heuristics to make it run faster, along with just good practice for an algorithm implementation.</p>

          <h4><a href="https://github.com/ryleyherrington/tsp">Traveling Salesman</a></h4>
          <p>Just an old school project that implements the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">traveling salesman problem</a> in C.</p>
